        <p> The German Shepherd,[a] also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size.
        The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.
        
        It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work,
        including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog,
        and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in
        2013.</p>

        <p> American bully (/traɪˈsɛrətɒps/ try-SERR-ə-tops;[1] lit. 'three-horned face') is a genus of chasmosaurine ceratopsian
        dinosaur that lived during the late Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous period, about 68 to 66 million years ago in
        what is now western North America. It was one of the last-known non-avian dinosaurs and lived until the
        Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The name Triceratops, which means 'three-horned face', is
        derived from the Greek words trí- (τρί-) meaning 'three', kéras (κέρας) meaning 'horn', and ṓps (ὤψ) meaning 'face'.
        
        Bearing a large bony frill, three horns on the skull, and a large, four-legged body, exhibiting convergent evolution
        with bovines and rhinoceroses, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best-known
        ceratopsian. It was also one of the largest, measuring around 8–9 m (26–30 ft) long and weighing up to 6–10 t (5.9–9.8
        long tons; 6.6–11.0 short tons). It shared the landscape with and was most likely preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus, though
        it is less certain that two adults would battle in the fanciful manner often depicted in museum displays and popular
        media. The functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have inspired countless debates.
        Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent interpretations find it
        probable that these features were primarily used in species identification, courtship, and dominance display, much like
        the antlers and horns of modern ungulates.</p>
